# Computer Graphics Fundamentals in HTML5 Canvas


## Introduction

In the early 1980s, black and white or low-color graphics at very low reoslutions were the only graphics capabilities available in personal computing. Now, desktop PCs and even smartphones contain graphics cards with the power of supercomputers, capable of executing with massive parallelism. Computer graphics have evolved drastically over the last 30 years.
