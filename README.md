# Computer Graphics Fundamentals

This is a repo where I will play with Canvas and computer graphics in both code and text. The goal is to write a series of posts explaining some of the basics (and not-so-basics) of computer graphics in the most accessible development environment available today: the web browser.

# Expected content

- Fundamentals
 - 2d
 - 3d
- Fractals
- Animation

.. more to come

# Suggestions

If you're actually reading this, wow! And, if you have any questions about computer graphics, I will try to answer them. There's a lot I don't know much about, but I'm game to at least try :)
